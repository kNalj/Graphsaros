I would recommend obtaining the program using this method because it makes updating the program much easier then other 
methods.
1) Download and install [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2) Open Git Bash, and [navigate](http://johnatten.com/2012/09/08/basic-git-command-line-reference-for-windows-users/#BASH-NAVIGATE-FILE-SYSTEM) to the destination where you wish to copy the project. (use **cd** command).
3) Go to the [project repository](https://github.com/kNalj/Graphsaros) and click the green "Clone or download" button.
   Copy displayed link.
4) In Git Bash type the following command: ```git clone https://github.com/username/example.git```.
   (where the example link is replaced with the link copied in step 3)

   Click download as ZIP.

### Call a friend to do it for you
1) Pick up your phone
2) Look trough your contacts until you find a person that might know how to do this
